# Introduction

Iam-Policies is based in 3 classes that together can be used to resolve many different problems. These classes are ActionBasedPolicy, IdentityBasedPolicy, ResourceBasedPolicy.

The first class you should know about is the _IdentityBasedPolicy_ class. This class represents permissions policy documents that control what actions an identity (users, groups of users, and roles) can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions.

These classes allow you to handle a more granular permission management base on JSON documents.
